8637,8638,The timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off .,2
8638,8639,"I admire it and yet can not recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .",1
8639,8640,A fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .,2

10096,10097,The type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the -LRB- teen comedy -RRB- genre a bad name .,1
10097,10098,Distinctly sub-par ... more likely to drown a viewer in boredom than to send any shivers down his spine .,1
10098,10099,Plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of TV 's Dawson 's Creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of Love Story .,1
